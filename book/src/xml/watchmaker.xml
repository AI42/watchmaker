  <title>The Watchmaker Framework</title>
  <para>
    Evolutionary algorithms can be implemented in any general purpose programming language.
    Most programmers will simply choose the language that they are most comfortable with.
    A quick web search will return examples of evolutionary programs written in C, C++,
    Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp and several other languages.

  <para>
    Performance may be a consideration in choosing which language to use.
    Almost all evolutionary algorithms are CPU-bound.  For this reason, compiled languages
    typically offer much better EA performance than interpretted languages.  For
    short-lived programs the difference is unlikely to be significant, but for
    long-running programs it could be considerable.
