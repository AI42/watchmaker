      Truncation selection is the simplest, and arguably least useful, selection strategy.

    <para>
      Sometimes good candidates can be lost when cross-over or mutation results in offspring
      that are weaker than the parents.  Often the EA will re-discover these lost improvements
      in a subsequent generation but there is no guarantee.  To combat this we can use a
      feature known as <emphasis>elitism</emphasis>.  Elitism involves copying a small
      propotion of the fittest candidates, unchanged, into the next generation.  This can
      sometimes have a dramatic impact on performance by ensuring that the EA does not waste
      time re-discovering previously discarded partial solutions.
      Candidate solutions that are preserved unchanged through elitism remain eligible for
      selection as parents when breeding the remainder of the next generation.

      <para>
        The Watchmaker Framework supports elitism via the second parameter to the
        <methodname>evolve</methodname> method of an <interfacename>EvolutionEngine</interfacename>.
        This elite count is the number of candidates in a generation that should be copied
        unchanged from the previous generation, rather than created via evolution.  Collectively
        these candidates are the <emphasis>elite</emphasis>.  So for a population size of 100,
        setting the elite count to 5 will result in the fittest 5% of each generation being copied,
        without modification, into the next generation.
