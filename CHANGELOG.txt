Changes in version 0.2.1
------------------------

* Reworked evolutionary operators to allow more flexibility.  Specifically,
* evolution can now be split into separate streams, which enables common
* genetic programming techniques to be used.

* Simplified the use of generics within the API.

* Fixed bug with pre-seeding populations.


Changes in version 0.2
----------------------

* Added support for concurrent fitness evaluations to take advantage of
  multi-core and multi-processor machines.

* Modified the way elitism is configured (the number of candidates to preserve
  is now specifed as an argument to the evolve method of the EvolutionEngine.

* Converted the Travelling Salesman example program into an applet that allows
  parameters to be tweaked and performance to be compared to a brute force
  implementation.

* Fixed RNG seeding to work in an untrusted applet environment (previously
  SecurityExceptions were thrown when attempting to access resources for
  seeding).
